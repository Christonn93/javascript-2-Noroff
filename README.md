### Brief
<p>
  You have been tasked with producing a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing social media platform. The client application must be attractive and        responsive, but you have an otherwise blank slate in terms of theme design language.

  Using the provided API and API documentation, create a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing and deleting social media content.

  Social API routes require authorisation via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). You will need to register an account and login to access your token.

  To complete the required features, you will also need to make use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.

  Using localStorage is highly recommended, especially for storing JWT tokens.

  A finished project fulfils the requirements below with an easy to use and error-free user interface.
